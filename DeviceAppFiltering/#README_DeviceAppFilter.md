# DeviceList Python Kandji Scripts usage

MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE VARIABLES BEFORE RUNNING THEM.

- First run "1.GetAllDeviceID.py", or at least make sure that you have iPhoneDevices.json and MacDevices.json
- Then according on what you need, you can list all thh apps from all the devices into a json file (depending if you run 2.List_iPhone_Apps.py for Mac listing or 2.List_iPhone_Apps.py for iPhones).
- If you want to get a list of users that use X app, use the 3.Parse_X_App.py)


_Please note that the filtering method on the scripts is using "emails" as main user ID. The devices must be assigned to users on Kandji. Thereof, have AD/Google Workspace linked._
