# Kandji Scripts for Lazy Admins

Some silly scripts I made to make my life easier. They rely or need Kandji to work properly (they generate Alerts for Kandji's Admin panel):

[Monitoring Scripts (monitoringscripts)](/monitoringscripts) - Few basic monitoring scripts like battery health status, FreeSpaceMonitor, etc.

[App Listing for iOS/MacOS devices (DeviceAppFiltering)](/DeviceAppFiltering) - Using Kandji API and Python, a list for installed Apps (in JSON) is generated. Giving the option to filter and create a list of users that use X app.






## Variables

To run some scripts, you will need to add/modify the following  variables on some scripts manually.

`API_KEY` - from [Kandji](https://support.kandji.io/support/solutions/articles/72000560412-kandji-api)

`subdomain` - Your Kandji's subdomain
