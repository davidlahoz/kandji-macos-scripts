# Kandji MacOS Scripts

Some silly scripts I made to make my life easier. Some of them rely on Kandji to work properly (they generate Alerts for Kandji's Admin panel and use Kandji CLI). They are created to avoid doing repetitive tasks, reporting, or just some configuration changes. They might be buggy, and I am sure they could be coded in a better way but... It ain't much, but it's honest work.

[Scripts](/Scripts) - A few basic monitoring scripts like battery health status, FreeSpaceMonitor, etc. They will use exit codes to show the results on Kandji.

[Utilities](Utilities) - Using Kandji API and Python, a list of installed Apps (in JSON) is generated. Giving the option to filter and create a list of users that use "X" app.






## Variables

To run some scripts, you must manually add/modify the following variables on some scripts.

`API_KEY` - from [Kandji](https://support.kandji.io/support/solutions/articles/72000560412-kandji-api)
