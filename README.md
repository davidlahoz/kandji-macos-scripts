# Kandji Scripts for Lazy Admins

Some silly scripts I made to make my life easier. They rely or need Kandji to work properly (they generate Alerts for Kandji's Admin panel). They are created to avoid doing repetitive tasks or sometimes vene reporting. They might be buggy, and I am sure they could be coded in a better way but... It ain't much but it's honest work.

[Scripts](/Scripts) - Few basic monitoring scripts like battery health status, FreeSpaceMonitor, etc. They will use exit codes to show the results on Kandji.

[Utilities](Utilities) - Using Kandji API and Python, a list for installed Apps (in JSON) is generated. Giving the option to filter and create a list of users that use X app.






## Variables

To run some scripts, you will need to add/modify the following  variables on some scripts manually.

`API_KEY` - from [Kandji](https://support.kandji.io/support/solutions/articles/72000560412-kandji-api)
